playful-geometer-site
=====================

The Playful Geoeter is currently limited by a difficult-to-hack PHP web cart system we use for [http://cosmic-spacecrafts.net](http://cosmic-spacecrafts.net).  A more flexible, extensible web page is required to give customers a more pleasant experience of navigating the site.

This project is an attempt to re-engineer the website for The Playful Geometer's 3D models and products into a more sensible relational database model.  It is also an attempt at gaining proficiency in some of the latest web development technologies including Django and its REST framework along with Angular JS.
